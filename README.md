# n8n-nodes-obsidian

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use information in Obsidian vaults in your n8n workflows. This is still a work in progress. 

Obsidian is a note-taking app that allows you to organize your notes into notebooks and create links between them. 

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

My exact use case is when I finish a script for a YouTube video, I can mark the script as complete and have a local ai build a description, then add frontmatter saying that step is done. It solves my need.
